Kraków's prehistory begins with evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the present site of the Wawel Hill.[14]
A legend attributes Kraków's founding to the mythical ruler Krakus, who built it above a cave occupied by a dragon, Smok Wawelski.
The first written record of the city's name dates back to 965, when Kraków was described as a notable commercial centre controlled first by Moravia (876–879),
but captured by a Bohemian duke Boleslaus I in 955.[15] The first acclaimed ruler of Poland, Mieszko I, took Kraków from the Bohemians and incorporated it into the
holdings of the Piast dynasty towards the end of his reign.
